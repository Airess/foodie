== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

The Ada Developers Academy has posed the following question: 

	Technical Reading Assessment

After reading the sections 1-1.3 of the sample from Ryan Bigg's Developing a RubyGem using Bundler, respond to the following questions (< 200 words per answer) in Markdown via GitHub Gist. Note: the intent of these questions is not to determine your level of programming knowledge, but to see how well you can interpret technical text, which is key to becoming a successful software developer. If there is any ambiguity, be sure to explain your answer.

    1. What does the command “bundle gem foodie” do?
    2. In what folder do we put our test files?
    3. What do we need to write to add the activesupport (version 4.0.0) dependency to our gemspec?
    4. What steps need to be taken to write a generator?


This application was designed to explore that question by building a sample rails application and a ruby gem using bundler.
